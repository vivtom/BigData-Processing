**Meningitis Disease Analysis in Nigeria** : 

**Overview**
This project analyzes meningitis disease outbreaks in Nigeria using data from the [Disease Outbreaks in Nigeria](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eiodelami/disease-outbreaks-in-nigeria-datasets) dataset on Kaggle. The aim is to extract meaningful insights by leveraging **Big Data technologies** like Hadoop and PySpark for data storage, processing, and analysis.  

**Project Workflow**  

1. **Dataset Selection & Filtering**  
   - Focused only on **meningitis** cases from the original dataset.  
   - Filtered out other diseases to improve analysis and ensure better insights.  

2. **Data Storage using Hadoop**  
   - Set up **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)** for efficient data storage and retrieval.  
   - Uploaded the filtered meningitis dataset to HDFS.  

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (PySpark)**  
   - Used **PySpark** in Jupyter Notebook for data transformation and cleaning.  
   - Handled missing values, standardized column formats, and removed inconsistencies.  

4. **Insights & Analysis**  
   - Extracted key trends and patterns, such as:  
     - **Age & Gender Distribution** of affected individuals.  
     - **Geographical Spread** of meningitis cases across different states.  
     - **Time-based trends** in outbreaks over the years.  
     - **Urban vs. Rural Analysis** of disease impact.  

**Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (for data analysis)  
- **Hadoop & HDFS** (for scalable data storage)  
- **PySpark** (for data processing and transformation)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)  

**Future Scope**  
- Building a **predictive model** to analyze outbreak trends.  
- Enhancing visualizations using **Power BI / Tableau**.  
- Expanding the analysis to include other diseases.
